# Frontend Agent Guidelines

> **This file governs all AI agents working on the React + Tailwind frontend.**
> It supplements — and does not replace — the root `AGENTS.md` (also accessible as `CLAUDE.md`).
> **All procedures defined here are mandatory. Non-compliance blocks commits and task completion.**

**Stack**: React 19 · TypeScript (strict) · Tailwind CSS · Vite · assistant-ui · Vercel AI SDK
**Backend target**: `POST /api/chat` (SSE, Vercel AI SDK Data Stream Protocol)

---

## Frontend Quality Standards

The following standards define acceptable work for all frontend code. Every item must be met before a commit or task completion.

- All new React components must have unit tests
- Critical and important user flows must have integration tests
- Every visual or layout change must be verified with Playwright (visual + functional)
- No `any` in TypeScript — use strict typing throughout
- No inline styles — use Tailwind utility classes exclusively
- Form validation must use Zod schemas
- Images must be resized to max 1024px on the client before upload
- All components must be functional — no class components
- Interfaces preferred over type aliases for object shapes
- Type Guards must be used wherever runtime type narrowing is needed

## Testing Infrastructure Setup (Frontend — Greenfield)

> This is a new project. Set up the testing stack from scratch using current best practices.

### Recommended Stack

| Tool | Purpose | Version target |
|---|---|---|
| **Vitest** | Unit and integration test runner (Vite-native) | latest stable |
| **React Testing Library** | Component testing with user-centric queries | latest stable |
| **@testing-library/user-event** | Realistic user interaction simulation | latest stable |
| **jsdom** | DOM environment for Vitest | via Vitest config |
| **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** | Mock API calls in tests (including SSE streams) | v2+ |
| **Playwright** | End-to-end and visual verification | latest stable (already available via plugin) |

### Initial Setup Commands

```bash
# Inside the Frontend/ directory
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts
npm install

# Testing dependencies
npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui jsdom
npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install -D msw

# Playwright (for E2E and visual verification)
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Vitest Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    globals: true,
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.ts'],
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'lcov'],
      thresholds: {
        lines: 80,
        functions: 80,
        branches: 70,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Test Setup File (`src/test/setup.ts`)

```typescript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
```

### MSW Setup for API Mocking (`src/test/mocks/`)

```typescript
// src/test/mocks/handlers.ts
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.post('/api/chat', () => {
    // Return mock SSE stream for testing
    const stream = new ReadableStream({
      start(controller) {
        controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode('0:"Mock response"\n'))
        controller.close()
      },
    })
    return new HttpResponse(stream, {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream' },
    })
  }),
]
```

### NPM Scripts (`package.json`)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:watch": "vitest",
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
    "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
    "lint": "eslint src --ext ts,tsx",
    "format": "prettier --write src",
    "format:check": "prettier --check src",
    "e2e": "playwright test"
  }
}
```

## Test-Driven Development Process (Mandatory)

TDD applies to frontend code exactly as it does to backend code. Follow this order for every component or feature:

### Step 1 — Read the Specification

Read the relevant section of `../docs/PRD-Sinsay-PoC.md`. Understand exactly what the component must render, what user interactions it must handle, and what the acceptance criteria are.

### Step 2 — Design the Tests

Before writing any component code, list:
- What the component renders by default
- What changes when the user interacts with it
- What error states it must handle
- What it communicates to parent components or the API

Write these as test names before implementing them.

### Step 3 — Write Component Tests First

Write failing test files before creating the component:

```typescript
// ReturnForm.test.tsx — written BEFORE ReturnForm.tsx exists
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import { ReturnForm } from './ReturnForm'

describe('ReturnForm', () => {
  it('renders all required fields', () => {
    render(<ReturnForm onSubmit={vi.fn()} />)
    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/order number/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
    expect(screen.getByLabelText(/purchase date/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
    expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i })).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('shows validation error when order number is empty', async () => {
    render(<ReturnForm onSubmit={vi.fn()} />)
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /submit/i }))
    expect(screen.getByText(/order number is required/i)).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

### Step 4 — Confirm Tests Fail

```bash
npm test
```

Tests must be red at this stage.

### Step 5 — Implement the Component

Write the minimum React code to make the tests pass.

### Step 6 — Run All Tests Green

```bash
npm test
```

All tests must pass. Fix the implementation, not the tests (unless the test was wrong).

### Step 7 — Playwright Verification (Mandatory)

After tests pass, perform visual and functional verification using Playwright tools. See the **Playwright Verification Process** section below.

---

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests — Required for All Components

Every React component must have a test file covering:

| Category | What to test |
|---|---|
| Rendering | Component renders without crashing; key elements are present |
| Props | Different prop values produce correct output |
| User interactions | Clicks, input changes, form submission trigger correct behavior |
| Validation | Invalid input shows correct error messages |
| Loading states | Spinner/skeleton appears during async operations |
| Error states | API errors are displayed correctly |
| Accessibility | Interactive elements have accessible names (ARIA) |

### Integration Tests — Required for Critical Flows

The following flows **must** have integration tests:

1. **Return form submission flow** — user fills form → submits → SSE stream starts → verdict appears
2. **Image upload and resize** — user selects image → client resizes to ≤1024px → correct payload sent
3. **Chat streaming** — SSE chunks arrive → chat UI updates incrementally → stream ends correctly
4. **Form validation with Zod** — invalid inputs trigger correct field-level errors
5. **Intent selection** — switching between `return` and `complaint` changes system prompt selection

Integration tests use MSW to mock the `/api/chat` SSE endpoint — never call the live backend in tests.

---

## Playwright Verification Process

**This process is mandatory after every visual change.** Use the Playwright plugin tools already available in Claude Code.

### Step 1 — Start the Development Server

```bash
cd Frontend && npm run dev
```

Confirm the server is running (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

### Step 2 — Open the Page

Use the `browser_navigate` tool to open the application URL.

### Step 3 — Capture Accessibility Snapshot

Use `browser_snapshot` to capture the full accessibility tree. Verify:
- All form labels are present and correctly associated
- Interactive elements have accessible roles and names
- Required ARIA attributes are present
- No orphaned or empty elements

### Step 4 — Take a Screenshot

Use `browser_take_screenshot` to capture the visual state. Verify:
- Layout matches the design specification from the PRD
- Tailwind classes produce the expected visual result
- No broken layouts, overflow, or missing elements
- Responsive behavior at the target viewport size

### Step 5 — Inspect Network Requests (for interactive features)

If the change involves API calls, use `browser_network_requests` after triggering the interaction. Verify:
- The correct endpoint is called (`/api/chat`)
- The request payload matches the expected format
- The SSE stream is received and rendered correctly

### Step 6 — Interact and Verify Behavior

Use `browser_click`, `browser_type`, and `browser_fill_form` to simulate real user interactions. Verify:
- Form validation triggers correctly
- Loading states appear and disappear as expected
- Chat responses render incrementally as SSE chunks arrive
- Error states display correctly for error scenarios

### Step 7 — DOM Structure Analysis

Use `browser_evaluate` to inspect specific elements when the snapshot is insufficient:

```javascript
// Example: verify image resize happened
() => document.querySelector('img')?.naturalWidth
```

### Step 8 — Self Code Review

Review the rendered output against your implementation:
- Does the DOM structure match what you intended to build?
- Are CSS classes applied correctly?
- Is the component tree structured correctly?
- Are there any console errors? (use `browser_console_messages`)

---

## Visual and Functional Verification

### What Constitutes Correct Visual Appearance

- Layout matches the wireframe/description in the PRD
- Tailwind spacing, color, and typography tokens are used correctly (no magic numbers, no inline styles)
- Components are responsive (test at 1280px desktop and 375px mobile)
- No visible overflow, clipping, or z-index issues
- Loading and error states are visually distinct and clear
- Polish text is rendered correctly (UTF-8, no encoding artifacts)

### What Constitutes Correct Functionality

- All form fields accept and validate input correctly
- Form submission calls the correct API endpoint with the correct payload
- SSE stream updates the chat UI in real time as chunks arrive
- Image resize happens client-side before upload
- Errors from the API are caught and displayed to the user
- No unhandled promise rejections or console errors in the browser

### Approval Criteria

A visual change is approved **only when**:
1. All unit and integration tests pass (`npm test`)
2. Playwright screenshot confirms the layout looks correct
3. Playwright interaction confirms the behavior works correctly
4. No console errors (`browser_console_messages` returns no errors)
5. DOM snapshot shows correct accessibility structure

## Task Completion Criteria (Frontend)

A frontend task is **complete** only when **all** of the following are true:

1. **Tests written first** — unit test files exist and were written before component code
2. **All tests pass** — `npm test` exits with zero failures
3. **TypeScript clean** — `tsc --noEmit` produces no errors
4. **Linting clean** — `npm run lint` produces no errors
5. **Playwright verification complete** — page opened, screenshot taken, DOM inspected, behavior confirmed
6. **Visual appearance correct** — screenshot matches specification, no layout issues
7. **Functional behavior correct** — interactions work as specified in the PRD
8. **No console errors** — browser developer console is clean
9. **Accessibility verified** — DOM snapshot confirms labels, roles, and ARIA attributes are correct
10. **Commit message correct** — follows `Area: summary` convention

**If any criterion is not met, the task is NOT complete.** Do not move to the next task.
